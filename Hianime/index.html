          <p>
            Do you know that according to Google, the monthly search volume for
            anime related topics is up to <br />
            over 1 Billion times? Anime is famous worldwide and it is no wonder
            we've seen a sharp rise in the <br />
            number of free anime streaming sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like free online movie streaming sites, anime watching sites
            are not created equally, some are <br />
            better than the rest, so we've decided to build HiAnime.to to be one
            of the best free anime streaming <br />
            site for all anime fans on the world.
          </p>

            subbed or dubbed anime in ultra <br />
            HD quality without any registration or payment. By having only one
            ads in all kinds, we are trying to <br />
            make it the safest site for free anime.
          </p>

          <h2>2/ Is HiAnime.to safe?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes we are, we do have only one Ads to cover the server cost and we
            keep scanning the ads 24/7 to <br />
            make sure all are clean, If you find any ads that is suspicious,
            please forward us the info and we will <br />
            remove it.

          <h2>
            3/ So what make HiAnime.to the best site to watch anime free <br />
            online?
          </h2>
          <p>

            sites, and learnt from them. We only <br />
            keep the good things and remove all the bad things from all the
